## Object Detection

**Computer vision** is a field of artificial intelligence that focuses on teaching computers to interpret and understand visual information. One popular and powerful technique used in computer vision for object detection is called **YOLO**, which stands for "You Only Look Once".

YOLO aims to identify and locate objects in an image or video stream in real-time. Unlike traditional methods that rely on complex pipelines and multiple passes, YOLO takes a different approach by treating object detection as a single regression problem.

This algorithm divides the input image into a grid and predicts bounding boxes and class probabilities for objects within each grid cell. It simultaneously predicts the class labels and their corresponding bounding boxes, making it incredibly efficient and fast. YOLO is known for its real-time performance, enabling it to process images and videos at impressive speeds.

By leveraging **deep convolutional neural networks**, YOLO can learn to recognize a wide range of objects and accurately localize them within an image. It can detect multiple objects of different classes simultaneously, making it particularly useful for applications where **real-time processing** and high detection accuracy are crucial, such as **autonomous driving**, **video surveillance**, and **robotics**.

## YOLOv8

**YOLOv8** is the latest version of the YOLO AI model developed by **Ultralytics**, which has shown effectiveness in tackling tasks such as **classification**, **object detection**, and **image segmentation**. **YOLOv8 models** are fast, accurate, and easy to use, making them ideal for various object detection and image segmentation tasks. They can be trained on large datasets and run on diverse hardware platforms, from **CPUs** to **GPUs**.
YOLOv8 _detection_ models have no suffix and are the default YOLOv8 models, i.e. **yolov8n.pt** ,and are pre-trained on COCO. See [Detection Docs ](https://docs.ultralytics.com/tasks/detect/) for full details.
